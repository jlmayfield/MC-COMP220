For these assignments you'll be returning to the familiar problem of detecting a palindrome. This time you'll pursue an ADT based implementation.
\end{abstract}

\section{Problem}

Design and implement the procedure \textit{isPalindrome} that utilizes the combination of a Stack and a Queue to test if a string is a palindrome.  Under the assumption that all stack and queue operations have constant complexity, is this implementation more or less efficient than the implementations we've seen previously. Submit your code with handin as assignment \textit{lab5} at the end of lab.
